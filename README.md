EXAMPLE: ROBOT ARMY

🌐 HIVE/SWARM/PHALANX SOLDIER: Running KALI LINUX. Kali Linux is a specialized distribution that includes a few designed purposes, including penetration, cybersecurity,offensive security and forensics testing.

🌐 HIVE/SWARM/PHALANX QUEEN: Running UBUNTU. Ubuntu is basically a SERVER and desktop distribution that also includes a lot of purposes. e.g HIVE/SWARM/PHALANX LEADER (server) with ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING CAPABILITIES USES MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING TO SOLVE A REAL WORLD PROBLEM FOR SOLDIER ROBOTS (client), FROM DATASETS WHICH THE SOLDIER ROBOTS GATHER IN THE FIELD, AND SERVES UP WEIGHTS/MODELS/CONFIG FILES/DOCKERFILES etc to them via client-server model or uses the new WEIGHTS/MODELS/CONFIG to build a new kind of ROBOT in a smartfactory compatible/outfitted with ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 ™ (but understand first that different deep learning weights/models may mean a different class of robot/a new type of ROBOT (see MACHINE MARRIAGES, SELF REPLICATION and LIBIDO in THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 ™) Documentation). In this context an ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 ™ SMARTFACTORY can also be the QUEEN (non-humanoid) or the WOMB of the QUEEN.

Installing
--

Generally, you should use [the free installer](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/getting-started/nightly-installers.html),
which contains all of the dependencies and will get you up and running with a
few clicks. See the [Dev Environment Setup](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/setting-up-a-metasploit-development-environment.html) if
you'd like to deal with dependencies on your own.

Using Metasploit
--
Metasploit can do all sorts of things. The first thing you'll want to do
is start `msfconsole`, but after that, you'll probably be best served by
reading [Metasploit Unleashed][unleashed], the [great community
resources](https://metasploit.github.io), or take a look at the
[Using Metasploit](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/basics/using-metasploit.html)
page on the documentation website.

Contributing
--
See the [Dev Environment Setup][devenv] guide on GitHub, which will
walk you through the whole process from installing all the
dependencies, to cloning the repository, and finally to submitting a
pull request. For slightly more information, see
[Contributing](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
